# Getting Started

## Installation

Pinafore is available as a Debian package for 64-bit Linux systems.
Install the latest one from [the release page](https://github.com/AshleyYakeley/Truth/releases).

This will put the executable program in `/usr/bin/pinafore`.

## Running

Try running one of the example files. Copy/paste [this example](examples/contacts.md) to `contacts` and run this:

    :::text
    chmod 755 contacts
    ./contacts

Alternatively, if you're curious about the type system, try running in [interactive mode](invocation.md#interactive-mode).

    :::text
    pinafore -i
