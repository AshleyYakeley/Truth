# Future Plans

[There's a lot more to do.](https://github.com/AshleyYakeley/Truth/issues)
These are some of the more important pieces of the puzzle:

* Storage of files, so the user can work with photos, videos, etc.
* Work with external data sources
* More reference types, e.g. `ListRef`, `TextRef`
* More user interface elements
* Dynamic entity types, with downcasting functions `DynamicEntity -> Maybe T`
* Importation of scripts into other scripts
